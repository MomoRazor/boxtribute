# ADR: Python ORM

## Status

Accepted, implementation complete. 

## Context

Since we are migrating off of the old PHP code base of Dropapp and into the new codebase of Python / React, 

## Decision drives

1. Learning Curve
2. Community Support
3. Power and Reliability considering it will be used in a production-ready environment

## Considered options

1. Pure SQL Strings (no ORM)
2. SQLAlchemy
3. [Peewee] (http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/)
4. [PonyORM] (https://ponyorm.org/)


## Decision
Peewee

## Consequences

### Easier


### More difficult
